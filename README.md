# Pixformer
Pixformer is a platform game inspired by Super Mario,
in which you can accumulate points by defeating enemies along your way
and grab coins and power-ups in order to reach the end of the level.

This project was originally made for the Object-Oriented Programming
course of the Computer Science and Engineering department of UniBo,
Cesena (original repo: [iamgio/OOP22-pixformer](https://github.com/iamgio/OOP22-pixformer))
and then extended for the Distributed System course.
