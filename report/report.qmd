# Concept

Pixformer is a GUI game designed as a clone of the classic 1985 *Super Mario Bros.*.  

Players take on the role of Mario, competing against each other to reach the end flag in horizontal levels, while collecting power-ups and defeating or avoiding enemies along the way.

#### Use case collection

The users will be interacting with the system while sitting in front of their own computer, connected to the Internet from different locations.
Although games will be started sporadically, interactions during a level are highly frequent
and happen via keyboard commands, which trigger events whose results are displayed on screen.

No data is stored, but a lot of information needs to be exchanged.

# Requirements

- The requirements must explain __what__ (not how) the software being produced should do. 
    * you should not focus on the particular problems, but exclusively on what you want the application to do.

- Requirements must be clearly identified, and possibly numbered

- Requirements are divided into:
    - **Functional**: some functionality the software should provide to the user
    - **Non-functional**: requirements that do not directly concern behavioural aspects, such as consistency, availability, etc.
    - **Implementation**: constrain the entire phase of system realization, for instance by requiring the use of a specific programming language and/or a specific software tool
        + these constraints should be adequately justified by political / economic / administrative reasons...
        + ... otherwise, implementation choices should emerge _as a consequence of_ design

- If there are domain-specific terms, these should be explained in a glossary

- Each requirement must have its own __acceptance criteria__
    + these will be important for the validation phase
    
#### Functional requirements

- During the game, a player will encounter different enemies, each with their own behavior:
    - Goomba: a small, brown, walking mushroom that can be defeated by jumping on it;
    - Koopa: a walking turtle that retreats into in its shell when jumped on. If a player hops on the shell, it will slide on the ground and damage any encountered entity in its path, including the player itself.

- A player can grab and use different power-ups:
    - Mushroom: increases Mario's height;
    - Fire flower: allows Mario to shoot fireballs.
  
  If the player is hit by an enemy and has active power-ups, the most significant one is lost.
  
- The game world is composed of different block types:
    - Surprise: when hit from below, it produces a power-up;
    - Destructible: when hit from below, it is destroyed;
    - Indestructible: cannot be destroyed.

- Each player has a score, which is earned by collecting coins and defeating enemies.

- A player's game ends if he: 
    - is damaged while in the smallest state;
    - falls into a pit;
    - reaches the end flag.
  
  A level finishes when all players have ended their game.
  
### Non-functional requirements

- The game must run on the three main operative systems without any major difference;
- The codebase must be maintainable and scalable;
- The latency must be minimal to ensure a good experience.

# Design

This chapter explains the strategies used to meet the requirements identified in the analysis.
Ideally, the design should be the same, regardless of the technological choices made during the implementation phase.

> You can re-order the sections as you prefer, but all the sections must be present in the end

### Architecture

- Which architectural style? 
    + why?

## Infrastructure

- are there _infrastructural components_ that need to be introduced? _how many_?
    * e.g. _clients_, _servers_, _load balancers_, _caches_, _databases_, _message brokers_, _queues_, _workers_, _proxies_, _firewalls_, _CDNs_, _etc._

- how do components	_distribute_ over the network? _where_?
    * e.g. do servers / brokers / databases / etc. sit on the same machine? on the same network? on the same datacenter? on the same continent?

- how do components _find_ each other?
    * how to _name_ components?
    * e.g. DNS, _service discovery_, _load balancing_, _etc._

> Component diagrams are welcome here

## Modelling

- which __domain entities__ are there?
    * e.g. _users_, _products_, _orders_, _etc._

- how do _domain entities_ __map to__ _infrastructural components_?
    * e.g. state of a video game on central server, while inputs/representations on clients
    * e.g. where to store messages in an IM app? for how long?

- which __domain events__ are there?
    * e.g. _user registered_, _product added to cart_, _order placed_, _etc._

- which sorts of __messages__ are exchanged?
    * e.g. _commands_, _events_, _queries_, _etc._

- what information does the __state__ of the system comprehend
    * e.g. _users' data_, _products' data_, _orders' data_, _etc._

> Class diagram are welcome here

## Interaction

- how do components _communicate_? _when_? _what_? 
- _which_ __interaction patterns__ do they enact?

> Sequence diagrams are welcome here

## Behaviour

- how does _each_ component __behave__ individually (e.g. in _response_ to _events_ or messages)?
    * some components may be _stateful_, others _stateless_

- which components are in charge of updating the __state__ of the system? _when_? _how_?

> State diagrams are welcome here

## Data and Consistency Issues

- Is there any data that needs to be stored?
    * _what_ data? _where_? _why_?

- how should _persistent data_ be __stored__?
    * e.g. relations, documents, key-value, graph, etc.
    * why?

- Which components perform queries on the database?
    * _when_? _which_ queries? _why_?
    * concurrent read? concurrent write? why?

- Is there any data that needs to be shared between components?
    * _why_? _what_ data?

### Fault-Tolerance

- Is there any form of data __replication__ / federation / sharing?
    * _why_? _how_ does it work?

- Is there any __heart-beating__, __timeout__, __retry mechanism__?
    * _why_? _among_ which components? _how_ does it work?

- Is there any form of __error handling__?
    * _what_ happens when a component fails? _why_? _how_?

### Availability

- Is there any __caching__ mechanism?
    * _where_? _why_?

- Is there any form of __load balancing__?
    * _where_? _why_?

- In case of __network partitioning__, how does the system behave?
    * _why_? _how_?

### Security

- Is there any form of __authentication__?
    * _where_? _why_?

- Is there any form of __authorization__?
    * which sort of _access control_?
    * which sorts of users / _roles_? which _access rights_?

- Are __cryptographic schemas__ being used?
    * e.g. token verification, 
    * e.g. data encryption, etc.

# Implementation

- which __network protocols__ to use?
    * e.g. UDP, TCP, HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC, XMPP, AMQP, MQTT, etc.
- how should _in-transit data_ be __represented__?
    * e.g. JSON, XML, YAML, Protocol Buffers, etc.
- how should _databases_ be __queried__?
    * e.g. SQL, NoSQL, etc.
- how should components be _authenticated_?
    * e.g. OAuth, JWT, etc.
- how should components be _authorized_?
    * e.g. RBAC, ABAC, etc.

## Technological details

- any particular _framework_ / _technology_ being exploited goes here

# Validation

## Automatic Testing

- how were individual components **_unit_-test**ed?
- how was communication, interaction, and/or integration among components tested?
- how to **_end-to-end_-test** the system?
    * e.g. production vs. test environment

- for each test specify:
    * rationale of individual tests
    * how were the test automated
    * how to run them
    * which requirement they are testing, if any

> recall that _deployment_ __automation__ is commonly used to _test_ the system in _production-like_ environment

> recall to test corner cases (crashes, errors, etc.)

## Acceptance test

- did you perform any _manual_ testing?
    * what did you test?
    * why wasn't it automatic?


# Release

- how where components organized into _inter-dependant modules_ or just a single monolith?
    * provide a _dependency graph_ if possible

- were modules distributed as a _single archive_ or _multiple ones_?
    * why?

- how were archive versioned? 

- were archive _released_ onto some archive repository (e.g. Maven, PyPI, npm, etc.)?
    * how to _install_ them?

# Deployment

- should one install your software from scratch, how to do it?
    * provide instructions
    * provide expected outcomes

# User Guide

- how to use your software?
    * provide instructions
    * provide expected outcomes
    * provide screenshots if possible


# Self-evaluation

- An individual section is required for each member of the group
- Each member must self-evaluate their work, listing the strengths and weaknesses of the product
- Each member must describe their role within the group as objectively as possible. 
It should be noted that each student is only responsible for their own section
